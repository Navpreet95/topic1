    <h2>Activity 1</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Iot Applications</em> is known for integrating internet access with
      everyday artefacts. it is a platform which connects various devices to the
      internet so that they can interact with each other. To explain with, we
      have smart surveillance, environment(Air quality management), wearable
      devices(glsses, watchs, heasets), and also smart home security systems.
      Futhermore, we discussed about the required features like connectivity,
      sensing, integration, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Activity 2</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Smart Building</strong> means making a room automated, which can
      perform different work quickly and able to solve a complex problem in a
      simipler way. For making building smart scenario there should be the
      function between system, people and the environment.
    </p>

    <h2>Activity 3</h2>
    <p>
      In this activity we discussed about high level features of
      <strong>Control Interface</strong> where we came to know that it include
      machine learning, remote access and AI enhance user experience: like save
      time and effort and get work done. The main uers are people that use those
      devices and need basically those which are concerned with the
      applications.
    </p>

    <h2>List of IoT applications</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the IoT applications:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Connected appliances</li>
      <li>Wearable health monitors</li>
      <li>Wireless inventory trackers</li>
      <li>Samrt home security systems</li>
      <li>Biometric cybersecurity scanners</li>
    </ol>
